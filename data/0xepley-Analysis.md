# üõ†Ô∏è PoolTogether

## Conceptual overview of the project:

The PoolTogether project encapsulates a decentralized finance protocol, ingeniously designed to offer a no-loss savings game powered by yield-generating activities on the Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, it's a protocol where users' deposits are pooled together to earn yield, and this yield is then distributed as prizes, adding a gamified incentive to save.

At the heart of the project lies the PrizeVault contract, which is the cornerstone of the PoolTogether V5 upgrade. The PrizeVault, a smart contract built on top of the ERC4626 standard, serves as a depository for user funds. It interacts with an underlying yield vault to employ deposited assets in yield-generating strategies. The yields accrued are then periodically liquidated into a prize pool token and distributed as prizes among depositors, who stand a chance to win without risking their principal investment.

The process begins when users deposit their tokens into the PrizeVault. Upon deposit, the corresponding number of shares, which represent the depositor's stake in the vault, are minted. These shares are not just static representations of the user's balance but are dynamically tracked using a TWAB (Time-Weighted Average Balance) mechanism, which is capable of capturing the user‚Äôs historical balances. This TWAB mechanism, managed by a separate TwabController, allows the protocol to determine the depositor's eligibility for prizes over time.

The integration with the ERC4626 standard offers composability with other DeFi protocols and allows the PrizeVault to be an autonomous entity capable of yield farming. Furthermore, the PrizeVault contains mechanisms to mitigate rounding errors in yield accruals, ensuring that users can reclaim the exact amount of their initial deposits, thereby reinforcing the 'no-loss' essence of PoolTogether.

When the yield is generated, it triggers the liquidation process. Here, a liquidation pair is used to auction the yield for the prize token, which is then contributed to the Prize Pool. This process is governed by a set of timed auctions that ensure efficient price discovery and incentivize participants to complete these transactions promptly.

The project‚Äôs architecture also includes a Factory pattern through the PrizeVaultFactory contract, allowing for the streamlined creation of new PrizeVaults with custom parameters. It provides an easy way to scale and create multiple prize-generating pools with diverse underlying assets.

A Claimable extension is integrated within the PrizeVault, enabling automated prize claims using an external claimer contract. It also facilitates the users to set custom hooks, essentially callback functions that execute upon the claim event, offering a bespoke touch to the prize distribution.

## Mathematical Overview of the PoolTogether Protocol

The PoolTogether protocol incorporates various mathematical functions and principles to manage its prize-linked savings system. Below, we delve into the core mathematical aspects of the protocol, focusing primarily on the `PrizeVault.sol` contract, which plays a crucial role in managing user deposits, yield generation, and prize distribution.

### Yield Generation and Distribution

#### 1. **Yield Buffer Management**
The `PrizeVault` contract utilizes a yield buffer to ensure that small rounding errors in yield generation don't affect the user's ability to withdraw their full deposit. The yield buffer (`yieldBuffer`) is a predefined quantity of assets reserved to cover these errors.



#### 2. **Asset and Share Conversion**
The protocol uses functions to convert between deposited assets and vault shares. These conversions account for the total debt (totalAssets - yieldBuffer) and the underlying yield vault's exchange rate to ensure users can always withdraw their deposits minus any incurred yield vault losses.

- **Conversion to Shares**:
  
  ```solidity
  function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalDebt_ = totalDebt();
        uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();
        if (_totalAssets >= totalDebt_) {
            return _assets;
        } else {
            return _assets.mulDiv(totalDebt_, _totalAssets, Math.Rounding.Down);
        }
    }
  ```

- **Conversion to Assets**:
  
  ```solidity
  function convertToAssets(uint256 _shares) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalDebt_ = totalDebt();
        uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();
        if (_totalAssets >= totalDebt_) {
            return _shares;
        } else {
            return _shares.mulDiv(_totalAssets, totalDebt_, Math.Rounding.Down);
        }
    }

  ```

#### 3. **Max Deposit and Withdraw Calculation**
The maximum deposit and withdrawal amounts are dynamically calculated to ensure the vault's total share supply doesn't exceed the `uint96` limit set by the `TwabController`, and to manage the total assets under yield generation without depleting the yield buffer.

- **Max Deposit Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function maxDeposit(address) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint256 totalDebt_ = _totalDebt(_totalSupply);
        if (totalAssets() < totalDebt_) return 0;

        uint256 twabSupplyLimit_ = _twabSupplyLimit(_totalSupply);
        uint256 _maxDeposit;
        uint256 _latentBalance = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 _maxYieldVaultDeposit = yieldVault.maxDeposit(address(this));
        if (_latentBalance >= _maxYieldVaultDeposit) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            unchecked {
                _maxDeposit = _maxYieldVaultDeposit - _latentBalance;
            }
            return twabSupplyLimit_ < _maxDeposit ? twabSupplyLimit_ : _maxDeposit;
        }
    }
  ```

- **Max Withdraw Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function maxWithdraw(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _maxWithdraw = _maxYieldVaultWithdraw() + _asset.balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 _ownerAssets = convertToAssets(balanceOf(_owner));
        return _ownerAssets < _maxWithdraw ? _ownerAssets : _maxWithdraw;
    }
  ```

#### 4. **Yield Fee and Liquidation**
A portion of the generated yield is reserved as a fee, which can be claimed by a designated yield fee recipient. The liquidation process involves converting the generated yield into the prize token, taking into account the yield fee percentage.

- **Yield Fee Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function liquidatableBalanceOf(address _tokenOut) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint256 _maxAmountOut;
        if (_tokenOut == address(this)) {
            // Liquidation of vault shares is capped to the TWAB supply limit.
            _maxAmountOut = _twabSupplyLimit(_totalSupply);
        } else if (_tokenOut == address(_asset)) {
            // Liquidation of yield assets is capped at the max yield vault withdraw plus any latent balance.
            _maxAmountOut = _maxYieldVaultWithdraw() + _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
  ```

- **Fee Accrual and Claiming**:
  
  ```solidity
  function claimYieldFeeShares(uint256 _shares) external onlyYieldFeeRecipient {
        if (_shares == 0) revert MintZeroShares();

        uint256 _yieldFeeBalance = yieldFeeBalance;
        if (_shares > _yieldFeeBalance) revert SharesExceedsYieldFeeBalance(_shares, _yieldFeeBalance);

        yieldFeeBalance -= _yieldFeeBalance;

        _mint(msg.sender, _shares);

        emit ClaimYieldFeeShares(msg.sender, _shares);
    }
  ```

These mathematical functions ensure that the PoolTogether protocol can manage user deposits, generate yield, and distribute prizes in a secure and efficient manner. The interactions between these functions enable the protocol to adjust to changing conditions, such as yield rates and asset values, ensuring the sustainability of the prize-linked savings system.

## Approach Taken while auditing the codebase
When auditing the PoolTogether protocol, I began by thoroughly reviewing the project documentation and existing audit reports. This initial step helped me understand the protocol's intended functionality, architecture, and security considerations from both a theoretical and a practical perspective.

Next, I delved into the smart contract codebase, starting with the core contracts such as `PrizeVault.sol`, `PrizeVaultFactory.sol`, and `TwabERC20.sol`, among others. My focus was to map out the interactions between these contracts and identify critical functionalities like asset deposits, yield generation, prize distribution, and the unique mathematical models used, including TWAB and random number generation.

To ensure a comprehensive audit, I analyzed the smart contracts for common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow issues, and improper access control. Special attention was given to the contracts' integration with external components like the Chainlink VRF and ERC4626 vaults, assessing how these interactions could impact the protocol's security.

I also scrutinized the protocol's handling of rounding errors and yield buffer management. Understanding these aspects was crucial, given their potential impact on prize distribution fairness and the overall "no loss" principle.

Moreover, I reviewed the tests accompanying the smart contracts to assess their coverage and effectiveness in catching edge cases and potential bugs. Wherever possible, I suggested improvements or additional test scenarios to enhance the protocol's robustness.

In summary, my auditing approach was methodical and thorough, combining a deep dive into the smart contracts, rigorous vulnerability assessment. My goal was to ensure the PoolTogether protocol's security, efficiency, and adherence to its innovative savings and prize distribution mechanisms.












### Systemic Risks

Systemic risks in PoolTogether primarily revolve around the dependencies on external protocols and services for yield generation and randomness. The protocol's reliance on external ERC4626 yield vaults and RNG services introduces potential systemic vulnerabilities, including smart contract failures or manipulations in the integrated protocols.


The `yieldVault` from `PrizeVault.sol` represents an external dependency on ERC4626 yield sources. A systemic failure in the yield source could impact the prize vault's ability to generate yield and thereby prizes for users.

### Centralization Risks

Centralization risks stem from the roles and permissions granted to certain addresses within the protocol. For instance, the ability of the admin or owner to adjust yield strategies and fee parameters introduces a central point of control.

**Example Code**:
```solidity
function setYieldFeePercentage(uint32 _yieldFeePercentage) external onlyOwner {...}
function setYieldFeeRecipient(address _yieldFeeRecipient) external onlyOwner {...}
function setLiquidationPair(address _liquidationPair) external onlyOwner {...}
```
These functions in `PrizeVault.sol` allow the owner to modify critical financial parameters, presenting a centralization risk if the owner's address is compromised or if the owner acts maliciously.

### Technical Risks

**Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Bugs or logical errors in the smart contracts can lead to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or unintended behavior. Given the complexity of contracts like the Shrine, interest rate models, and oracle interactions, the attack surface is significant.

**Scalability Concerns:** As transaction volumes grow, the platform must scale without compromising performance or security.

### Integration Risks

Integration risks are primarily associated with the protocol's interactions with external DeFi platforms for yield generation and RNG services for random number generation. The protocol's security and functionality are contingent upon the reliability and integrity of these external services. Any changes or failures in the integrated platforms, such as smart contract upgrades, API modifications, or service discontinuations, could disrupt the protocol's operations. Moreover, the evolving landscape of DeFi presents a risk of compatibility issues, where updates in connected protocols could necessitate adjustments in PoolTogether's contracts to maintain seamless functionality and security.

## New insights and learning of project from this audit:
During the audit of the PoolTogether project, several key insights and learning opportunities emerged, highlighting the project's innovative approach to decentralized finance and its integration within the Ethereum ecosystem. The audit provided a deep dive into the mechanics of no-loss prize games, the use of yield-generating strategies, and the complexities of smart contract development and security. Below are some of the primary insights and learnings derived from this audit:

1. **No-Loss Prize Game Mechanics**: The concept of no-loss prize games, where users deposit funds that generate yield in DeFi protocols, with the yield being distributed as prizes, is both innovative and complex. Understanding how PoolTogether manages user deposits, generates yield, and allocates prizes required a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between different smart contracts and external DeFi protocols.

2. **Time-Weighted Average Balance (TWAB)**: The use of TWAB for fair and transparent prize distribution is a sophisticated approach to addressing the randomness and fairness in prize allocation. The audit process offered a deeper understanding of how TWAB works, including the mathematical principles underlying its implementation, and its significance in ensuring that the prize allocation process is both random and weighted towards users with longer deposit durations.

3. **Security Implications of External Integrations**: PoolTogether's reliance on external protocols for yield generation and random number generation (RNG) introduces various security considerations. The audit process emphasized the importance of evaluating the security and reliability of these external services, as well as the mechanisms through which PoolTogether interacts with them. This included an assessment of fallback procedures and contingency plans in case of external service failures.

4. **Yield Strategies and Financial Risks**: Analyzing the yield strategies employed by PoolTogether, including the integration with various DeFi yield sources, provided valuable insights into the financial risks and rewards associated with such strategies. The audit examined the mechanisms for optimizing yield generation, managing risks, and the potential impact of market volatility on the protocol's financial health.


The audit of PoolTogether not only highlighted the project's innovative contribution to the DeFi space but also provided a comprehensive learning experience on the technical, security, and financial aspects of building and maintaining a decentralized protocol. These insights are valuable for the ongoing development of PoolTogether, as well as for the broader DeFi community and future projects in the space.
