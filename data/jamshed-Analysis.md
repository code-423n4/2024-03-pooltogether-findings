# Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

We approached manual code review by looking into each space in the scoped contract and decided to explain some core functional contracts.it is important to note that manual code reviews can be very time-consuming.

Main contracts:

- pt-v5-vault/src/PrizeVault.sol
- pt-v5-vault/src/PrizeVaultFactory.sol
- pt-v5-vault/src/TwabERC20.sol
- pt-v5-vault/src/abstract/Claimable.sol
